-- 1. Display the order_details table and the customer_id field from the orders table

SELECT *, 
(SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE id = od.order_id) as customer_id
FROM order_details od

-- 2. display the order_details table where shipper_id=3

SELECT * 
FROM order_details
WHERE order_id IN (SELECT id FROM orders WHERE shipper_ID = 3)

-- 3. Select rows from the order_details where quantity>10, find the average quantity

SELECT order_id, AVG(quantity) AS avg_quantity
FROM (SELECT * FROM order_details where quantity > 10) AS temp
GROUP BY order_id

-- 4. Same selection as 3 using the WITH statement

WITH temp AS (SELECT * FROM order_details where quantity > 10)
SELECT order_id, AVG(quantity) AS avg_quantity
FROM temp
GROUP BY order_id

-- 5. Function with two parameters that divids the first parameter by the second
